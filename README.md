# Global Addresses

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openaddresses/openaddresses.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openaddresses/openaddresses)

A global collection of address data sources, open and free to use. Join, download and contribute. We're just getting started.

## Contributing addresses

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/osmlab/addresses/issues/new) and give information about where to find more address data. Be sure to include a link to the data and a description of the coverage area for the data.
- You can also create a pull request to the [sources](https://github.com/osmlab/addresses/tree/master/sources) directory.

## Usage

The goal for this project is simply to collect data sources.
See [openaddresses-download](https://github.com/openaddresses/openaddresses-download)
for a tool to download this data.

## Why collect addresses?

[Ian](http://github.com/iandees) spent a lot of time tracking down [address data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVnlPsfrhUIdEVZTzVFalFYYnlvTkc0R05wcUpsWVE&usp=drive_web) for the US and he wanted to share that work with others.
