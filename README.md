# osmlab addresses

A repository of tools to retrieve and build an open database of addresses for the world.

## Why?

[I](http://github.com/iandees) spent a lot of time tracking down [address data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsVnlPsfrhUIdEVZTzVFalFYYnlvTkc0R05wcUpsWVE&usp=drive_web) and I want to share that work with others.

## License

Although individual sources of data might have their own licenses, the goal is that the database as a whole be released under [Public Domain](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/) license.
