Hello, I'm writing on behalf of the OpenAddresses Project. I found your contact information from {SOURCE OF CONTACT INFORMATION}. I'd like to ask for your help in getting {COUNTRY/REGION/CITY}'s data added to openaddresses.io.

Our project is an open-source, volunteer effort that is working to collect and standardize address data for the world. We believe that this data is important and should be available to everyone through projects like OpenStreetMap. Thanks to support from groups like the Open Data Institute and Code for America, we already have data from more than 650 sources.

Is {COUNTRY/REGION/CITY}'s address data available for inclusion in OpenAddresses? I would greatly appreciate any information you have about the availability of this data, or even just pointers to people who might know. If you are aware of any open data initiatives that might affect the data's availability, I would be interested to hear about them as well.

Thanks very much for your time and your help--if you have any questions about the project, I'd be glad to answer them.
